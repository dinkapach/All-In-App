# All In 

The main idea of our application, “All In”, is to allow its users to consolidate all of their club memberships in one place.

All In is a cross platform application written with Ionic framework.

## Description
In our days, people face difficulties with tracking all of their club memberships,
and even don't really remember all of the clubs they are registered to.
Club members are mostly not aware of the sales and discounts in the clubs,
they forget to use their credits and can't track their points.

We have decided to develop a platform that provides a solution for this problem, both for the businesses and for the customers.
Additionally, we have developed an application that helps the application's manager to manage the data base.


#### Actions for club members:
* ##### Quick register

  Customer can register for a club by scanning a QR code

* ##### View previous transactions

  The customer can follow their previous transactions by viewing scanned receipts, that were scanned when they have made the purchase.

* ##### Save credits

  In case that the customer returns a product and receives credits in return, they can scan those credits and use them by presenting the   scan in the store.

* ##### Sales & Discounts

  The customer can view the sales and discounts that are offered by each of the clubs that he is registered to.

* ##### Points

  The customer can follow the points that were accumulated in any of their various memberships.

* ##### Manually Club

  The customer can add a club that is not registered to All In, or a business that doesn’t offer a membership, and manage and organize     the statements in their account manually.

* ##### Edit Profile

  The customer can edit their profile, e.g. they can change their address, password, profile picture etc.

#### Actions for club manager

* ##### Customers view

  The club manager can view a list of his registered customers. Additionally, they can search certain customers by a chosen category,     such as ID number, name, last name, number of points etc.

* ##### Removing a registered customer

  The club manager can cancel the membership of a registered customer easily and quickly.

* ##### Statistics

  The club manager can produce statistics reports that show how many customers have purchased this month, how many joined the club,       segmentation of customers by age. These reports enable the manager to get a broad perspective on his business.

* ##### Sales edit

  The club manager can add or edit deals that he would like to offer to their customers.
